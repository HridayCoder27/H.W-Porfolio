            <p>My hobby is playing out-door sports such as basketball, cricket, badminton, tennis and many more others. Before because of my online classes I could not play these game, but as now recently I have got my summer vacations on. So I have got my opportunity for a month and I have been trying it to utilise it by spending it on my favorite hobby. Playing out-door sports is typically pursued for purposes of physical exercise, general wellbeing, spiritual renewal, and an opportunity to partake in nature whilst doing so.
